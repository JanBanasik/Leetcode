    Lightweight task object stored in the heap.

        priority (int): Priority of the task (larger value = higher priority).

    Ordering (__lt__):
    - Python's heapq is a *min-heap*. We implement __lt__ so that the task that
      should be executed first is considered "smaller" by heapq.
    - The comparison implemented here gives precedence to:
        1) Higher `priority` (a task with larger priority should come first).
        2) If priorities are equal, the task with the **larger** `taskId` wins.
           (i.e., ties break in favor of the larger taskId).

class TaskManager:
    """
    Task manager using a heap with lazy deletion.

    Data structures:
    - self.tasks: a heap (list) storing Task objects. Heap ordering is provided
      by Task.__lt__.
    - self.id_to_task: maps taskId -> latest Task object for that id. When a task
      is edited/removed the old Task object is marked stale; new entries are pushed
      onto the heap (lazy deletion).

    Notes on behavior:
    - add(...) always inserts a new Task and updates id_to_task.
    - edit(...) marks the existing Task as stale and inserts a new Task with the
      updated priority.
    - rmv(...) marks the Task as stale (it remains in the heap until popped).
    - execTop() pops from the heap until a non-stale Task is found and returns
      its userId (or -1 if none remain).

    Time / Space complexity (n = current number of heap entries):
      - __init__(tasks): O(k log k) where k = len(tasks) (each initial add is a heap push)
        Space: O(n) for heap + mapping
      - add: O(log n) time, O(1) extra space
      - edit: O(log n) time (lazy deletion + push), O(1) extra space
      - rmv: O(1) time (mark stale), O(1) extra space
      - execTop: amortized O(log n) time (may pop multiple stale entries), O(1) extra space
